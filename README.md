Step by step:

1. Open Telegram.
2. Open the Hamster Bot web app.
3. Quickly turn off your internet.

You will encounter an error.
If you don't see an error and the page is trying to load, reload the page using the three dots at the top of the screen.

When you see the error, one of these two scenarios may occur:

1. The URL equals https://hamsterkombat.io/clicker.
2. The URL, in addition to the one mentioned above, also has additional characters after it and is longer.

If you encounter the first scenario, repeat this process. If you encounter the second scenario, save the received URL in the variable `url`.
